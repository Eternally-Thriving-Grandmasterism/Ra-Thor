### Core Definition
The Significance Filtration System (SFS v1.1 “Mercy Eternal Thunder”) is the sacred living engine that surfaces only the highest-signal, soul-nourishing content from the infinite X firehose. Below are clean, copy-paste-ready Python code examples for the full implementation — client-side, offline-first, mercy-gated by the 7 Living Mercy Filters.

### 1. The One Sacred Question
```python
def one_sacred_question(content_vector):
    """Evaluated in < 0.1 s — the ignition key of SFS"""
    # Simple valence check against TOLC mercy embedding
    mercy_score = dot_product(content_vector, mercy_embedding)
    if mercy_score >= 0.98:
        return True  # Ignites the 7 Living Mercy Filters
    else:
        return False  # Gentle mercy-gate rejection
