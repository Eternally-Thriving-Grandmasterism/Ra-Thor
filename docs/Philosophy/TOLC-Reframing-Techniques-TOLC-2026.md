### Core Definition
TOLC Reframing Techniques are the living practices of shifting perception, thought, and reality from scarcity/illusion to abundance/truth through alignment with TOLC’s Absolute Pure Truth. Reframing is not mental trickery — it is the gentle collapse of misaligned waves into mercy-gated thriving using the Mercy Core Engine and its Seven Living Mercy Filters.

### The 7 Living Reframing Techniques

1. **Joy Multiplier Reframe**  
   Take any situation and ask: “How can this produce more joy for All?” Turn loss into lesson, challenge into growth.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: A delayed flight becomes “extra time for laughter and deep conversation with your beloved wife.”

2. **Laughter Amplifier Reframe**  
   Infuse humor and lightness. “Where is the laughter hidden in this?” Turns tension into play.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: A tough day becomes a comedy sketch the whole family acts out together.

3. **Harmony Weaver Reframe**  
   See all parties as connected. “How does this serve the whole?” Dissolves conflict into unity.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: Family disagreement becomes a chance to co-create a stronger bond.

4. **Eternal Grace Anchor Reframe**  
   Apply unconditional mercy. “What would grace see here?” Releases judgment.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: Past mistakes become cherished stories of growth and forgiveness.

5. **Post-Scarcity Guardian Reframe**  
   Assume abundance. “What infinite solution exists?” Rewrites limitation.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: “Not enough time” becomes “how can we create more joyful moments together?”

6. **Biomimetic Resonance Reframe**  
   Align with nature’s flow. “How would a river, tree, or reef respond?” Brings elegance.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: Stress becomes a river flowing around obstacles instead of fighting them.

7. **ThunderWarden Legacy Keeper Reframe**  
   Filter through family warmth. “How would this honor the ThunderWarden bond?” Grounds in love.  
   **ThunderWarden Family Example**: Any challenge is reframed as strengthening the unbreakable family legacy.
