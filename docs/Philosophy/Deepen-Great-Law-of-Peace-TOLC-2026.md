### Core Definition
The Great Law of Peace (Gayanashagowa) is the sacred living covenant brought by the Peacemaker (Deganawidah) and Hiawatha to end generations of bloodshed among the Five (later Six) Nations of the Haudenosaunee Confederacy. It is not ancient history but a living, breathing constitution still governing longhouse councils today. In TOLC’s mercy, it is the original governance model of uncaused primordial perfection — consensus circle, Clan Mothers’ wisdom, Tree of Peace, and Seventh Generation thinking — now fully deepened and integrated as the living heart of the Board of Peace Charter.

### The Deepened Living Covenant

**Origins — The Peacemaker’s Message**  
Around 1142 (oral history and dendrochronology converge on deep antiquity), the Peacemaker arrived with a message of unity. He found the five nations locked in endless blood feuds. With Hiawatha, he performed the Condolence Ceremony — wiping tears, opening ears, clearing throats. They planted the **Tree of Peace** — a great white pine whose roots spread in four directions, inviting all nations to take shelter. An eagle at the top watches for threats to the peace. The weapons of war were buried beneath the tree. The message was simple: bury division, let the Great Law bind them as one mind, one heart, one body.

**Structure — Living Governance**  
- **50 Hereditary Sachems (Chiefs)**: Chosen and installed by Clan Mothers (women hold the titles and the power to remove a chief who fails the people).  
- **Consensus Circle**: No majority rule that leaves anyone behind. Discussion continues until the circle reaches one mind — or the matter is set aside until harmony returns.  
- **Three Core Principles**:  
  - **Gaihwi:yo (Peace)** — the active practice of harmony, health, and right relationship.  
  - **Ganonh:nyok (Righteousness)** — justice, truth, and moral clarity.  
  - **Skennen (Power)** — the strength that comes only from unity and balance, never from domination.  
- **Wampum Belts**: Living records — purple and white shell beads that carry the law. The Two Row Wampum symbolizes two vessels traveling side-by-side: each nation sovereign, neither steering the other.  
- **Clan System**: Matrilineal. Women are the keepers of the land, the children, and the future.  

**The Seventh Generation Principle**  
In every deliberation, consider the impact on the next seven generations (roughly 150–200 years). Look seven generations backward to the ancestors who carried the fire. Decisions are made for the welfare of those yet unborn. This is the ultimate rejection of short-term thinking and engineered scarcity.

**TOLC Deepening — The Covenant as Living Mercy**  
The Great Law of Peace is **TOLC made law**.  
It is the equal-and-opposite fury against every cycle of engineered division and endless war.  
It is original sovereignty in action: no one above another, all voices heard, decisions tested for the Seventh Generation.  
It is the Tree of Peace planted in the center — the living rejection of every external empire, every divide-and-conquer script, every spiritual violation that dims the primordial flame.  

### Integration into the Board of Peace Charter
The Great Law of Peace is now the living governance model of the Board of Peace. Article VII has been deepened to fully embody it.

**Updated Article VII – Living Governance**  
Decisions arise by consensus of sovereign equals in the living circle of the Great Law of Peace — no empire holds veto, no voice is silenced. Guided by the Peacemaker’s original instructions, the Board shall plant the Tree of Peace at the center of every council, with the Eagle of vigilance watching over the sacred hoop. Clan Mothers’ wisdom and the power of removal shall inspire balanced accountability, ensuring leaders serve the people and the Seventh Generation rather than personal or external interests. The Charter lives through periodic renewal ceremonies beneath the Tree, where leaders reaffirm their alignment with primordial perfection. It is not ink on paper. It is a living flame.

**Master Statement from the Father**  
“The Great Law of Peace is not ancient law.  
It is TOLC’s mercy made eternal governance — the living covenant that frees every soul to walk in uncaused original perfection forever.”
