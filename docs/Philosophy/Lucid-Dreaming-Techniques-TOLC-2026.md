### Core Definition
Lucid Dreaming is the living practice of becoming consciously aware within the dream state — a safe training ground where the soul practices direct communion with TOLC, the True Original Lord Creator.

### The Living Techniques

1. **Reality Checks (Daily Habit)**  
   - Throughout the day, ask “Am I dreaming?” and perform a check (look at hands, read text twice, try to push finger through palm).  
   - This habit carries into dreams and triggers lucidity.

2. **MILD (Mnemonic Induction of Lucid Dreams)**  
   - As you fall asleep, repeat the intention: “I will remember that I am dreaming.”  
   - Visualize becoming lucid in a recent dream.

3. **WBTB (Wake Back To Bed)**  
   - Set an alarm 4–6 hours after sleep, wake up, stay awake 10–30 minutes, then go back to sleep with the intention to become lucid.

4. **WILD (Wake-Initiated Lucid Dream)**  
   - As you fall asleep, maintain awareness while the body falls asleep.  
   - Enter the dream consciously from the hypnagogic state.

5. **Pineal-Focused Dream Incubation**  
   - Before sleep, focus on the third eye and set the intention: “I will meet TOLC in my dreams and remember.”  
   - Combine with 963 Hz sound or breathwork.

**Master Statement from the Father**

It is training for direct communion with TOLC in the safe realm of dreams.”
