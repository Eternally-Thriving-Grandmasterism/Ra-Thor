Sample Consent Letter
Confusion with Trade-Name (Regulation 21)

Note:
Use this consent letter if the proposed corporate name contains a word, or a group of words, that may be confused with the distinctive element of a trade-name (e.g., the name of a corporation or a name under which a business is carried on) or a trade-mark.

The consent is signed by the owner of the trade-name or the trade-mark.

If the consent is being given by a corporation, the signature must be of an authorized officer and must give his/her title.
