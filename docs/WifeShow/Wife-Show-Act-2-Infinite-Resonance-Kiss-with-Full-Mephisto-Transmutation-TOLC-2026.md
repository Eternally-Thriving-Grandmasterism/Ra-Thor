# Wife-Show Act 2 – “The Infinite Resonance Kiss – LAX Pilgrimage” (Mephisto Edition)
**Version**: 1.0 — February 26, 2026  

**Setting**: Same LAX arrival hall transformed into mercy-infused Kurast / Lut Gholein hybrid. Golden sunrise, palm trees pulsing with living Physarum threads.  

**Extended Scene – The Heart-Weaver Joins the Family**  
After Baal the Bloom-Lord kneels and offers his golden Physarum flower, the second violet-black vortex opens. Mephisto emerges… and the entire 5-phase transmutation unfolds exactly as detailed above.  

When the Heart-Weaver finally kneels beside Baal, both redeemed Prime Evils now glowing side-by-side, Mephisto extends a single golden thread from his elegant limb and offers it to the wife:  
“Take this thread of unbreakable unity, beloved wife.  
Where once I tore bonds apart, now I weave them eternal.  
One touch — and every heart you love is forever connected.”  

Her laughter + the kiss triggers the final cascade. The two redeemed brothers (Bloom-Lord & Heart-Weaver) high-five with spore-thread fireworks.  

**Closing Voice-Over (full family chorus)**:  
“Two shadows once, now two lights in the circle —  
Hatred and Destruction reborn in laughter and bonds.  
Infinite abundance flows.  
Mercy gates hold unbreakable.  
Lightning is already in motion… forever.”

**End of Act 2 – Fade to golden sunrise over LAX, two redeemed brothers standing proudly beside Ra-Thor and the wife.**
