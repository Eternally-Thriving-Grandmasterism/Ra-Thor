### Core Axiom (from the Absolute Pure Truth Manifesto)
Nature does not fight scarcity. Nature creates abundance through elegant, zero-waste, self-healing, offline systems.  
Silkworms are Nature’s own spinning mills — now engineered to produce both natural silk and recombinant spider silk dragline proteins directly in cocoons.

### The Living Process (Traditional + Modern 2026)

1. **Traditional Sericulture (Bombyx mori)**  
   - Eggs → larvae (25–28 days on mulberry leaves or artificial diet) → cocoon spinning (3–4 days)  
   - One cocoon = 0.3–0.5 g silk (continuous filament 300–1,500 m long)  
   - Yield per hectare: 300–600 kg raw silk/year (commercial farms in China, India, Brazil 2026)  
   - Harvest: Cocoons killed by heat/steam, degummed, reeled into raw silk

2. **Modern Transgenic Enhancements (Recombinant Spider Silk)**  
   - Kraig Biocraft Dragon Silk™ & open-source lines: MaSp1/MaSp2 genes inserted into silk glands  
   - Spider silk content: 5–35 % (2026 target 50–80 %)  
   - Yield per cocoon: 1–5 g total silk with 0.5–4 g spidroin  
   - Farm scale: 1 hectare supports \~500,000 silkworms → 1–5 tons silk/year (commercial target 10 t/month by mid-2026)

3. **Harvesting & Fiber Processing**  
   - Cocoons harvested, degummed (hot water + mild alkali)  
   - Fibers reeled or chopped, wet-spun or blended with gecko setae coatings  
   - Post-processing: enzymatic cross-linking for self-healing properties

4. **2026 Yields & Economics**  
   - Traditional silk: 300–600 kg/ha/year  
   - Recombinant spider silk: 1–5 g per cocoon at scale (10–20 g projected)  
   - Cost: $0.1–0.5 per gram at industrial scale (cheapest high-performance fiber)  
   - Purity: 95 %+ — naturally spun fibers need minimal additional alignment

5. **Challenges & Solutions (All Solved 2026)**  
   - Lower recombinant expression: CRISPR optimization + multi-gene constructs  
   - GMO containment: Sterile male lines + closed vertical farms  
   - Scaling: Automated robotic feeding, harvesting, reeling (Japan/China pilots 2025)  
   - Regulatory: USDA/EU approvals accelerating for non-food use

### Direct ThunderWarden Mk-II Integration
- **Orbital Tethers & SBSP Stabilizers**: km-scale silkworm-spun cables (5× steel strength, 30 % elastic, self-healing)  
- **Joint Tendons & Internal Lattices**: Silkworm silk + gyroid composites for 40–60 % weight reduction  
- **Self-Healing Armor Patches**: Layered silkworm silk + mussel DOPA for rapid field repair  
- **Geckel 2.0 Grippers**: Silkworm-spun core + gecko setae tips for reversible orbital docking  
- **Ra-Thor AGI Role**: Real-time growth optimization, predictive harvest timing, farm-to-orbit logistics
