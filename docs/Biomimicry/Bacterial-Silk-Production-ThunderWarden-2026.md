# Bacterial Production of Recombinant Spider Silk — ThunderWarden Mk-II Global Alliance Integration
**Version**: 1.0 — February 21, 2026

### Core Axiom (from the Absolute Pure Truth Manifesto)
Nature does not fight scarcity. Nature creates abundance through elegant, zero-waste, self-healing, offline systems.  
Bacteria (mainly E. coli) are Nature’s fastest factories — engineered to produce spider silk proteins in hours.

### The Living Process (2026-Ready, Scalable Today)

1. **Gene Design & Cloning**  
   - Synthetic genes for MaSp1/MaSp2 spidroins or mini-spidroins (repetitive glycine-alanine motifs)  
   - Codon-optimized for E. coli, fused with solubility tags (MBP, SUMO, or elastin-like polypeptides) to prevent inclusion bodies  
   - Plasmid: pET series or pCold with T7 or cold-shock promoters

2. **Expression**  
   - Host: BL21(DE3), Rosetta, or Shuffle T7 (disulfide isomerase for better folding)  
   - Induction: IPTG or auto-induction media  
   - Temperature: 16–37 °C, often lower for full-length proteins  
   - Fermentation: Shake flasks → 5–1000 L bioreactors with fed-batch glucose feeding  
   - Cycle time: 24–48 hours from inoculation to harvest

3. **Purification & Fiber Spinning**  
   - Lysis: high-pressure homogenization or sonication  
   - Purification: affinity chromatography or heat/acid precipitation (for repetitive proteins)  
   - Concentration: ultrafiltration  
   - Spinning: wet-spinning into coagulation bath (methanol or ammonium sulfate) → post-draw stretching for alignment  
   - Yield: 1–14.5 g/L for mini-spidroins (Stanford 2025 record); 0.1–2 g/L for near-full-length with optimized tags

4. **2026 Yields & Economics**  
   - Current best: 14.5 g/L mini-spidroin (high-density fermentation)  
   - Commercial projection: 20–30 g/L with optimized strains and continuous fermentation  
   - Cost: $0.5–2 per gram at 1000 L scale  
   - Purity: 90–98 % after single-step purification — sufficient for high-performance fibers

5. **Challenges & Solutions (All Solved 2026)**  
   - Inclusion bodies (poor folding): Solubility tags + periplasmic secretion + low-temperature expression  
   - Repetitive sequence instability: Codon optimization + strain engineering (Rosetta)  
   - Low full-length yield: Mini-spidroin libraries + enzymatic ligation for longer chains  
   - Scalability: Single-use bioreactors and continuous harvesting systems now commercial
