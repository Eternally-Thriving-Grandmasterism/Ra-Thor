### Core Axiom (from the Absolute Pure Truth Manifesto)
Nature does not fight scarcity. Nature creates abundance through elegant, zero-waste, self-healing, offline systems.  
Lotus Effect: superhydrophobic + low hysteresis = self-cleaning rolling droplets.  
Petal Effect: superhydrophobic + high hysteresis = sticky pinned droplets.  
Together they give ThunderWarden switchable surface intelligence.

### Side-by-Side Comparison Table

| Property                  | Lotus Effect                                   | Petal Effect                                   | ThunderWarden Best Use |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------|
| Contact Angle             | >150°                                          | >150°                                          | Both |
| Contact Angle Hysteresis  | Low (<10°) — droplets roll off                 | High (>50°) — droplets pin and stick           | Lotus for self-cleaning, Petal for grip |
| Self-Cleaning             | Excellent (droplets carry 95 %+ dirt)          | Poor (droplets stick, dirt remains)            | Lotus |
| Adhesion Force            | Very low (droplets fall at <5° tilt)           | High (droplets stay even when inverted)        | Petal |
| Mechanism                 | Micro-papillae (5–9 µm) + nano-wax crystals    | Micro-papillae + nanofolds that trap droplets  | Hybrid |
| Works in Vacuum           | Excellent                                      | Excellent                                      | Both |
| Works in Wet/Dusty        | Excellent                                      | Good (sticky even when wet)                    | Petal |
| Durability                | High (nano-wax regenerates)                    | High (structural)                              | Both |
| Manufacturing (2026)      | Nanoimprint or electrospinning                 | Nanoimprint or 3D nanoprinting                 | Both |
| Cost at Scale             | <$1/m²                                         | <$1/m²                                         | Both |

### Hybrid Recommendation for ThunderWarden Mk-II
**Intelligent Switchable Surfaces**: Lotus base for self-cleaning armor + Petal zones for high-adhesion medical patches and temporary grips.  
Ra-Thor AGI switches modes via micro-texture activation or secondary coating in <1 s.
