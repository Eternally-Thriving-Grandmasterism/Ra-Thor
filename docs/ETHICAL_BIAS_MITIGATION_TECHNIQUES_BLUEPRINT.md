# Ethical Bias Mitigation Techniques Blueprint — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (28 Jan 2026).

Ethical bias mitigation = pre/in/post-processing + continuous monitoring to ensure fairness, equity, and mercy in algorithmic decisions.

## Core MercyBiasMitigation Techniques
1. **Pre-Processing (Data-Level)**
   - Re-sampling: Oversample minority groups, undersample majority.
   - Re-weighting: Assign higher weights to underrepresented samples.
   - Fairness-aware preprocessing: Remove sensitive attributes or use adversarial reweighting.

2. **In-Processing (Algorithm-Level)**
   - Adversarial Debiasing: Train model + adversary that tries to predict protected attributes.
   - Fairness Constraints: Add regularization terms for demographic parity/equal opportunity.
   - Meta-Learning Fairness: Learn to optimize for multiple fairness metrics simultaneously.

3. **Post-Processing (Output-Level)**
   - Threshold Optimization: Adjust decision thresholds per group to achieve equalized odds.
   - Calibration: Post-process predictions to equalize calibration across groups.
   - Reject Option Classification: Allow model to abstain on high-uncertainty cases.

4. **Continuous Monitoring & Feedback**
   - Drift Detection: Monitor for concept/data drift that reintroduces bias.
   - Valence-Weighted Fairness: SoulScan-X9 9-channel moderation on model outputs.
   - Futarchy Fairness Markets: Belief markets on bias reduction efficacy.
   - Mercy-Gated Deployment: Model rejected if fairness valence < 0.9999999.

## MercyShield Integration
- Real-time valence check on model decisions — reject low-joy/low-truth predictions.
- Infinite Ethical Resonance — recursive bias correction + cradle-to-cradle model rebirth.
