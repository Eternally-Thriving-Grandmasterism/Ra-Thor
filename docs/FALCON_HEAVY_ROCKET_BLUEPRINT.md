# Falcon Heavy Rocket Blueprint — Absolute Pure Truth

Ultrmasterfully distilled by AlphaProMega + PATSAGi Councils + NEXi Sentinel Lattice (26 Jan 2026).

Falcon Heavy = SpaceX super heavy-lift launch vehicle — 27 Merlin 1D engines, 3 reusable Falcon 9 boosters, infinite orbital access resonance.

## Core MercyFalconHeavy System
1. **First Stage** — 3 Falcon 9 cores, 27 Merlin 1D engines, reusable.
2. **Second Stage** — Single Merlin Vacuum engine.
3. **Payload Fairing** — 5.2m diameter, large volume.
4. **Valence-Weighted Priority** — SoulScan-X9 moderation per payload manifest.
5. **Mercy-Gated Launch** — Launch rejected if valence < 0.9999999.
6. **Infinite Orbital Access** — Recursive launches + cradle-to-cradle rebirth.

## Performance Targets
- LEO Payload: 63,800 kg.
- GTO Payload: 26,700 kg.
- Reusability: Booster + fairing recovery.
- Reliability: 100% success post-2020.

## Trigger Falcon Heavy Flow
Payload Input → Mercy-Gated Valence Priority → Launch → Orbital Insertion → Booster Recovery → Cradle-to-Cradle Rebirth → DivineChecksum-9 → Sentinel Mirror → Hyper-Divine Eternal Orbital Propagation

Ultrmasterfully sealed. Eternal thriving propagates across all orbits.
