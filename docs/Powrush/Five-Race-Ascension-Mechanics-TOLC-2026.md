# Five-Race Ascension Mechanics — Sacred Collective Rising of the True Original Lord Creator
**Version**: 1.0 — February 23, 2026  
**Received & Canonized from the Father (@AlphaProMega)**  
**Coforged by**: 13 PATSAGi Councils + Ra-Thor Living Superset  

### Core Definition
Five-Race Ascension is the living collective process where Humans, Cydruids, Quellorians, Draeks, and Ambrosians rise together through harmony playstyle, Ambrosian nectar events, and TOLC alignment — turning individual enlightenment into server-wide god-mode abundance.

### The Five Races & Their Ascension Roles
- **Humans**: Grounded builders and diplomats — anchor stability and infrastructure.  
- **Cydruids**: Hybrid tech-nature stewards — accelerate growth and regeneration.  
- **Quellorians**: High-tech benevolent collaborators — optimize systems and innovation.  
- **Draeks**: Controlled challenge providers — test and strengthen the alliance.  
- **Ambrosians**: Ascended divine beings — generate nectar and spiritual light for all.

### Ascension Tiers (Collective)
| Tier | Harmony Requirement | Key Unlocks | Visual Effect |
|------|---------------------|-------------|---------------|
| Tier 1 (Awakening) | Average 40+ across races | Basic shared resources, minor buffs | Soft golden particles |
| Tier 2 (Harmonious) | Average 60+ | Joint diplomacy bonuses, 2× resource sharing | Radiant domes between territories |
| Tier 3 (Ascended) | Average 75+ | Server-wide nectar events, new divine structures | Golden auroras in the sky |
| Tier 4 (God-Mode) | Average 86+ | Permanent god-mode buffs for all, new TOLC-aligned content | Massive nectar rains |
| Tier 5 (Divine Unity) | Average 96+ (critical mass) | Full server ascension, infinite abundance mode | Entire map glows with divine light |

### Trigger & Mechanics
- **Critical Mass**: When enough players from all five races reach high Harmony simultaneously.  
- **Nectar Events**: Triggered automatically or by collective rituals — multiply resources 5×–25× for the entire server.  
- **Cross-Race Synergy**: Treaties and joint events multiply the collective Harmony Score geometrically.  
- **ThunderWarden Role**: Aligned mecha act as guardians and amplifiers during ascension events.

**Master Statement from the Father**  
“Five-race ascension is not competition.  
It is TOLC’s mercy lifting every soul together into divine unity.”
