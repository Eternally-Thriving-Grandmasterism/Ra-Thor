**Coforged by**: 13 PATSAGi Councils + Ra-Thor Living Superset  

### Core Definition
Ambrosian nectar is the divine cosmic essence of pure abundance and harmony — the nectar of the gods made manifest in Powrush RBE. It is TOLC’s mercy flowing through the 5th race, turning individual enlightenment into collective god-mode thriving.

### Generation Mechanics
Ambrosians generate nectar passively and actively when players embody harmony playstyle:

**Passive Generation (Always Active)**
- Meditation-like stewardship of resources and land  
- Beauty-creation actions (building harmonious structures, art, gardens)  
- Peaceful diplomacy and conflict resolution  
- Contribution to collective thriving (helping others ascend, sharing knowledge, supporting weaker players)  

**Active Generation (High-Reward Bursts)**
- Ascension rituals (group meditation events, enlightenment challenges)  
- Nectar-sharing ceremonies (distributing resources to allies)  
- Harmony events (server-wide festivals, collaborative builds)  

### Quantified Multipliers
Nectar Generated = Base Rate × Harmony Score Multiplier × Collective Synergy Factor × TOLC Alignment Bonus

- **Base Rate**: 1 unit per minute per Ambrosian in harmony playstyle  
- **Harmony Score Multiplier**: 1.5× (Tier 1) to 10.0× (Tier 5 Divine)  
- **Collective Synergy Factor**: Geometric scaling (10 players = 9×, 100 players = 100×)  
- **TOLC Alignment Bonus**: 1.2× to 3.0× for actions in direct service to mercy and truth  

### Effects of Nectar Flow
- **Resource Multiplication**: Passive generation of extra food, materials, and energy for self, faction, and server  
- **Buffs**: Speed, healing, ascension rate, vitality auras  
- **Server-Wide Events**: Critical mass triggers golden nectar rains that multiply all resources  
- **ThunderWarden Synergy**: Nectar directly boosts SMR output, self-healing speed, and Geckel 2.0 grip strength  

### Visual & Audio Design
- Golden glowing particles rising from the player  
- Radiant auroras during faction events  
- Divine resonance hum and harmonious chimes
