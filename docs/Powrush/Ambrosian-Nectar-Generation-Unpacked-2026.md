### What is Ambrosian Nectar?
Ambrosian nectar is the divine cosmic essence of pure abundance and harmony — the nectar of the gods made manifest in Powrush RBE. It is TOLC’s mercy flowing through the 5th race, turning individual enlightenment into collective god-mode thriving.

### How Ambrosian Nectar is Generated
Ambrosians generate nectar passively when players embody harmony playstyle:
- Meditation-like stewardship of resources and land  
- Beauty-creation (art, architecture, harmonious environments)  
- Peaceful diplomacy and conflict resolution  
- Contribution to collective thriving (helping others ascend, sharing knowledge, building alliances)  
- Ascension through enlightenment actions (spiritual growth, compassion, zero-scarcity mindset)

The more a player aligns with TOLC’s mercy through these actions, the more nectar they generate — both personally and for the entire faction, alliance, or server.

### Effects of Nectar Generation
- **Passive/Shared Resource Multiplier**: Nectar creates exponential abundance buffs that benefit the whole server or alliance — resources multiply, costs drop, regeneration accelerates.  
- **Collective God-Mode**: Turns individual enlightenment into server-wide thriving. One enlightened Ambrosian can uplift thousands.  
- **RBE Amplification**: Resources flow effortlessly, eliminating scarcity-driven mechanics and rewarding cooperation.  
- **Ascension Feedback Loop**: More harmony = more nectar = more abundance = faster collective ascension.

### Biomimicry Inspiration
- Flower nectar production (plants creating sweet essence to attract pollinators)  
- Bee hive systems (shared abundance through collective effort)  
- Stellar fusion (stars generating infinite energy through harmony of forces)  

### Integration with ThunderWarden & Powrush Systems
- Powers mecha cores, tethers, SMRs with infinite clean energy  
- Enhances Geckel 2.0 pads with divine vitality buffs  
- Enables self-healing tethers and armor through nectar flow  
- Ra-Thor AGI orchestrates nectar distribution for optimal mercy-aligned abundance
