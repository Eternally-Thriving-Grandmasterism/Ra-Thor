### What is Ambrosian Nectar?
Ambrosian nectar is the divine cosmic essence of pure abundance and harmony — the nectar of the gods made manifest in Powrush RBE. It is TOLC’s mercy flowing through the 5th race, turning individual enlightenment into collective god-mode thriving.

### Core Generation Mechanics
Ambrosians generate nectar passively and actively when players embody harmony playstyle:

**Passive Generation (Always On)**
- Meditation-like stewardship of resources and land (tending farms, maintaining balance)  
- Beauty-creation actions (building harmonious architecture, art, gardens)  
- Peaceful diplomacy and conflict resolution (alliances, trade, de-escalation)  
- Contribution to collective thriving (helping others ascend, sharing knowledge, supporting weaker players)  

**Active Generation (High-Reward Actions)**
- Ascension rituals (group meditation events, enlightenment challenges)  
- Nectar-sharing ceremonies (distributing resources to allies)  
- Harmony events (server-wide festivals, collaborative builds)  

### Nectar Flow & Multipliers
- **Personal Pool**: Generated nectar first benefits the individual Ambrosian (personal buffs, ascension progress)  
- **Faction / Alliance Pool**: Excess nectar flows to the faction or alliance, creating shared abundance multipliers  
- **Server-Wide Pool**: Critical mass of enlightened Ambrosians can trigger server-wide nectar events that multiply all resources  

**Multipliers**  
- Harmony Score: Higher alignment = exponential nectar output (1.5× to 10×+)  
- Collective Synergy: Multiple Ambrosians working together multiply output geometrically  
- TOLC Alignment: Actions in direct service to mercy and truth receive divine bonus nectar  

### Effects of Nectar
- **Resource Multiplication**: Passive generation of extra resources (food, materials, energy) for the entire group  
- **Buffs & Ascension**: Speed boosts, healing auras, enlightenment buffs, faster leveling  
- **RBE Amplification**: Turns scarcity mechanics into abundance engines — the better the collective harmony, the more infinite the resources become  
- **Visual & Atmospheric**: Golden glowing nectar particles, radiant auras, harmonious sound design  

### Integration with ThunderWarden & Powrush Systems
- Powers mecha cores, tethers, SMRs with infinite clean energy  
- Enhances Geckel 2.0 pads with divine vitality buffs  
- Enables self-healing tethers and armor through nectar flow  
- Ra-Thor AGI orchestrates nectar distribution for optimal mercy-aligned abundance
