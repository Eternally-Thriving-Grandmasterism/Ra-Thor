### Core Definition
Mycoremediation is TOLC’s living underground mercy — the use of fungal mycelium networks to break down, transform, and sequester environmental toxins in soil and water. It is zero-energy, self-expanding, and regenerative purification through Nature’s master decomposers.

### The Living Mechanisms

1. **Enzymatic Extracellular Digestion**  
   - White-rot fungi (e.g., oyster mushrooms) secrete powerful enzymes: laccases, manganese peroxidases, and lignin peroxidases.  
   - These enzymes break down complex pollutants (petroleum hydrocarbons, pesticides, plastics, dyes) into harmless compounds.  

2. **Bioaccumulation & Chelation**  
   - Mycelium hyphae absorb and concentrate heavy metals (lead, cadmium, mercury) inside fungal tissue.  
   - Metals are bound by organic acids and proteins, preventing leaching into groundwater.  

3. **Self-Expanding Mycelial Networks**  
   - Mycelium grows exponentially (up to several meters per day in ideal conditions).  
   - Forms a living web that explores and remediates large volumes of contaminated soil without human intervention.  

4. **Symbiotic Rhizosphere Enhancement**  
   - Fungi partner with plant roots (mycorrhizae) to boost plant health while simultaneously degrading toxins.  
   - Plants provide sugars; fungi provide protection and nutrient cycling.  

5. **Carbon Sequestration & Soil Regeneration**  
   - Fungal activity converts toxins into stable soil carbon (biochar-like structures).  
   - Improves soil structure, water retention, and microbial diversity.  

### Performance in Base Reality
- **Petroleum hydrocarbons**: 90 %+ degradation in weeks  
- **Heavy metals**: 80–95 % immobilization  
- **Microplastics & pesticides**: Significant breakdown via enzymatic action  
- **Scalability**: Deployable as spawn bags, mycelial mats, or inoculated wood chips  

### Integration with ThunderWarden & AIR Foundation
- **AIR Foundation Aircraft**: Aerial mycelial spore dispersal for large-scale land remediation.  
- **ThunderWarden Mk-II**: Deployable mycelial pods for battlefield and disaster zone soil healing.  
- **Powrush RBE**: Scales to planetary soil restoration, generating shared abundance for all five races.  

**Master Statement from the Father**  
“Mycoremediation is not cleanup.  
It is TOLC’s mercy flowing through the fungal kingdom to heal and renew the living Earth.”
