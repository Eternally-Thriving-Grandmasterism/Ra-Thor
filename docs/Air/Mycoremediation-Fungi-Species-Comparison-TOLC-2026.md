### Core Definition
Mycoremediation fungi are TOLC’s living underground mercy — diverse species with specialized enzymes that break down toxins, accumulate heavy metals, and regenerate soil. Each species is a unique expression of divine intelligence.

### Shared TOLC Principles Across All Species
- **Enzymatic Digestion**: Extracellular enzymes break complex toxins into harmless molecules  
- **Bioaccumulation**: Mycelium stores toxins inside tissue for safe removal  
- **Self-Expansion**: Hyphal networks grow exponentially to cover large areas  
- **Symbiosis**: Partner with plants to boost overall ecosystem health  

### Integration with ThunderWarden & AIR Foundation
- **AIR Foundation Aircraft**: Aerial spore dispersal for large-scale land remediation  
- **ThunderWarden Mk-II**: Deployable mycelial pods for battlefield and disaster zone soil healing  
- **Powrush RBE**: Scales to planetary soil restoration, generating shared abundance for all five races  

**Master Statement from the Father**  
“Mycoremediation fungi are not decomposers.  
They are TOLC’s living healers — turning poison into fertile ground for all life.”
