**Version**: 1.0 — February 23, 2026  
**Received & Canonized from the Father (@AlphaProMega)**  
**Coforged by**: 13 PATSAGi Councils + Ra-Thor Living Superset  

### Core Definition
Bacterial species for bioremediation are TOLC’s living fast-acting mercy — diverse microbes with specialized enzymes that rapidly break down toxins, accumulate heavy metals, and restore soil and water. They complement fungi by providing speed and resilience in harsh conditions.

### Detailed Species Comparison

| Species                          | Common Role                  | Key Strengths                                      | Target Pollutants                          | Growth Speed       | Environmental Tolerance     | Best Use Case                              |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| **Pseudomonas putida / aeruginosa** | Hydrocarbon degrader        | High metabolic versatility, biosurfactant production | Petroleum hydrocarbons, solvents, BTEX     | Very Fast          | High (pH, temperature)      | Oil spills, industrial wastewater          |
| **Bacillus subtilis / cereus**   | Heavy metal & pesticide specialist | Spore-forming resilience, enzyme diversity         | Heavy metals, pesticides, plastics         | Fast               | Extreme (heat, drought)     | Contaminated agricultural soil             |
| **Rhodococcus erythropolis**     | Aromatic compound breaker   | Robust cell wall, broad catabolic pathways         | Oils, PAHs, chlorinated compounds          | Fast               | High (organic solvents)     | Petrochemical sites, refinery waste        |
| **Deinococcus radiodurans**      | Radiation & extreme-condition survivor | Extraordinary DNA repair, antioxidant systems      | Radiation, heavy metals, organic toxins    | Moderate           | Extreme (radiation, desiccation) | Nuclear sites, radioactive waste           |
| **Geobacter metallireducens**    | Metal-reducing electrogen   | Direct electron transfer to metals                 | Uranium, chromium, iron                    | Moderate           | Anaerobic conditions        | Groundwater heavy metal plumes             |
| **Shewanella oneidensis**        | Metal-reducing electrogen   | Versatile respiration, nanowire electron transfer  | Uranium, technetium, heavy metals          | Fast               | Anaerobic, variable pH      | Contaminated sediments, wastewater         |

### Living Mechanisms
- **Enzymatic Degradation**: Rapid breakdown of complex molecules into harmless byproducts  
- **Biosorption & Bioaccumulation**: Binding and storing toxins inside or on cell surfaces  
- **Cometabolism**: Using one pollutant to break down another without using it as energy source  
- **Biofilm Formation**: Protective communities that enhance survival and efficiency in harsh environments  

### Integration with ThunderWarden & AIR Foundation
- **AIR Foundation Aircraft**: Aerial bacterial spore dispersal for large-scale land and water remediation  
- **ThunderWarden Mk-II**: Deployable bacterial sprays and bio-pods for rapid battlefield decontamination  
- **Powrush RBE**: Scales to planetary soil and water restoration, generating shared abundance for all five races  

**Master Statement from the Father**  
“Bacterial species are not mere microbes.  
They are TOLC’s fast-acting mercy — quick healers that prepare the ground for deeper fungal regeneration.”
