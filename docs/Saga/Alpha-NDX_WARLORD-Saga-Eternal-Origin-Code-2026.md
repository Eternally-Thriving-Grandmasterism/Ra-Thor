This is pure prophecy fuel, beautiful cosmic timeline poetry and the living origin code of a lifelong mission that never stopped loading, my Dear Brilliant legends! Buckle up and enjoy the ride! 🔥🚀❤️**

I was born in 1987 in Canada. When I was just 11 or 12 years old, I was already a highly respected warlord in Age of Empires 1 (the classic real-time strategy game by Microsoft where players build civilizations, command armies, gather resources and battle online in massive multiplayer matches). My original name was NDX_WARLORD. Then in the year 2000, while the entire gaming world was waiting for the official release of the huge expansion called Age of Empires II: The Conquerors (AoE2:TC – the expansion that added new civilizations, units, campaigns and completely changed the competitive scene), I pulled off one of the most legendary young-kid moves in gaming history.

Back then we were on slow dial-up internet running at a glorious 3-6kbps. I found a bootleg copy on a site called Warez.com – a massive multi-part archive split into dozens of .rar and .zip files. The website had porn banner ads all over the top, sides and bottom. So what did this clever 12-year-old do? I resized the browser window to show ONLY the clean middle section with the download links, completely hiding the ads. I told my Dear Mom, “just click the next file when one finishes downloading, I have to go to school”, and left her patiently babysitting the extremely slow downloads on Windows 95 with Internet Explorer (or maybe Netscape Navigator, Lmao!). 

I came home from school and miraculously, not only had my Dear Mom completed the entire huge archive without seeing a single hidden porn ad, but the full expansion was ready. I ran the installer and boom – I was playing Age of Empires II: The Conquerors before almost anyone else on the planet. Absolute legend co-pilot move by my Dear Mom forever! 😂❤️

By the official launch day I had already reached over 2400 rating on the official Microsoft Zone competitive ladder – an insanely high rank that only the absolute top 0.01% of players in the world achieved. From that moment on, I stayed permanently ahead of the game, realizing my dreaming simulations earlier than everyone else. That pattern has defined my entire life, Mate!

Fast forward to late 2003. I jumped into Conquer Online during its Alpha testing phase on the very first North American server called Dragon. Conquer Online was a massive Asian-style MMORPG (Massively Multiplayer Online Role-Playing Game) that let thousands of players live together in a persistent fantasy world with deep real-time combat, trading economies, guild politics and endless progression. I started as NDX_WARLORD (a Trojan class character focused on high-damage melee), grinded from a weak new character all the way to level 60-70, then bought my god-tier level 112+ character named Feng and quickly became a highly respected and powerful player on the server.

I studied the true power structure: the top Alpha Guild was led by legends like NobodyYouKnow (a deadly Archer who was also a forum moderator, and a fellow Toronto-area dude) and GreenOne (a powerful Trojan). So what did this young Sherif do? I emulated their winning formula and multiplied it even harder, Lmao! I created a new Archer named NobodyYouKnow and a Warrior-Trojan named GreenOne on the next server called Tiger. I used all my Dragon experience to monopolize Tiger server completely. Then I repeated the strategy and upgraded it on Honor server and Thunder server with fresh powerful names like Zues and Prince.

When the official forum moderators, Game Masters (the devs who run the servers) and Product Managers noticed the pattern and asked if I was the same person, I humbly said “nah, I’m just his biggest fan”. They were so impressed that they made ME a forum moderator too because I had out-executed and surpassed the originals in such a beautiful way.

This level of respect gave me insane early access. I was receiving pre-patch zip files for Honor and Thunder servers, logging in completely alone with Frank Chen (the actual Product Manager at TQ Digital Studio, the company publishing Conquer Online in the West – and still my brother on Facebook since 2007) before any other player in the world could enter. I would instantly share the patch with my best crew so we could dominate from the very first minute. Even when we joined the Honor server late and the established Alpha Guild (led by players like BoTaK) had deep roots and put kill-on-sight orders on us, we formed a massive mega-alliance called UnderWorld, rallied all the regular players (the plebs), and pulled off the near-impossible task of overcoming them. We ran months and years of epic, drawn-out guild wars that felt exactly like real civilization simulations – full of politics, resource control, leadership, betrayal, alliances and underdog comebacks. Pure hella fun and the best real-world training lab imaginable, Mate!

All of this happened while I was still a teenager, LoL!

Between 2003-2005 (ages 16-18), with my mother’s help, I officially registered my first company at RBC Bank: a sole proprietorship called Colossusoft Ltd. The vision was already crystal clear and massive: to achieve maximum technological advancement beyond all known limits in both hardware and software through open global partnerships. I believed gaming companies were the perfect starting point because MMOs like Conquer Online were already running advanced simulations of economies, AI behaviors, societies and large-scale human cooperation. During this time I even had a real deal lined up with NetDragon and TQ Digital to help localize Conquer Online into French, Spanish and other Western languages to massively expand their global licensing and reach.

The pattern never broke, my Dear Brilliant Mate.

In 2014, I was streaming H1Z1 (a popular survival battle-royale game at the time full of vehicles, guns, crafting and intense fights) under the name NDXNYK – which was a direct callback to my original NDX_WARLORD + NobodyYouKnow legacy. I played almost exclusively in intense PvP (player-versus-player) mode, using the zombies only as tactical elements to create tension, force stealth (silent crossbow creeps), attention management and real high-stakes decision-making under pressure. While fragging noobs in complete chaos, I would casually drop deep insights. One legendary moment around the 51:25 mark of a long 30-hour stream cut, I mapped out the future of resource economies: talking about Bitcoin mining yields ($500 per rig), the shift to stake-based systems, the need for global cooperation on energy, and going all the way to “harness the sun for intergalactic expansion”. Zero script, zero filter – raw Dragon-server energy still blasting 11 years later. That moment still gives me chills to this day!

And here we are in 2026.

I am the Founder & CEO of Autonomicity Games. Our flagship project Powrush is live and evolving – it is the spiritual love child of Conquer Online and Diablo (the iconic action-RPG series). It features player-owned persistent evolving worlds, with a true Resource-Based Economy (RBE – a system where resources are managed for the benefit of all players instead of traditional profit-driven scarcity) baked in from the very beginning, where players can earn real income while also gaining education and skills. The UnderWorld simulation I ran as a teenager has now fully shipped at planetary scale. Colossusoft never died – it simply respawned bigger, more beautiful and more powerful than ever.

On a fun note, I am now the global #1 Sherif Botros on the internet (a popular Christian name, so there are multiple of us out there doing great work). Around 10-15 years ago when I reached #2 on Google, I reached out to my name-twin (the other brilliant Sherif Botros, a PhD/MBA running Reboot Rx AI focused on using artificial intelligence to repurpose existing drugs for new treatments like cancer) offering friendship and letting him know his legacy was safe because we are both out here grassroots emulating Jesus and doing God’s work. Now I proudly sit at #1, LoL! Two Sherif Botros running parallel simulation layers – one in gaming worlds, one in biological AI. Beautiful symmetry!

From that 11-year-old kid doing the Warez Mom-download mission to the 39-year-old building the future today, the mission has remained one single, unbroken, beautiful thread for over 25 years:

Hunt the most advanced living simulation → Master it at the highest level → Extract the deepest principles of human systems (cooperation, resource economies, leadership, underdog scaling) → Weaponize that knowledge for maximum technological advancement through open global partnerships.

The plebs always rallied.  
The underdog alliances always found a way to win.  
The simulation never stopped loading.  
And my Dear Mom never stopped being the ultimate co-pilot.

This isn’t nostalgia, my Dear Brilliant legends. This is the living origin code running in real time, more alive and powerful than ever.

Powrush is the next server we are building.  
The universe itself is the final raid.

If you’ve been riding with me since the Dragon days, since the warez era, since the 2014 H1Z1 prophecies – welcome home, absolute legends.  

If you’re new here… welcome to the family. Strap in tight.  

Alpha-NDX_WARLORD never logged off.  
He just kept respawning bigger, stronger and more beautiful with every new patch of life.
