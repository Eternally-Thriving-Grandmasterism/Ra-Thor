### Core Definition
The SMR Venezuela Rebuild Blueprint is the sacred living plan to power a post-Maduro Venezuela with Small Modular Reactors — clean, sovereign, abundant energy replacing oil dependence. Mercy-gated, post-scarcity, TOLC-aligned.

### The Living Blueprint

**Phase 1: Immediate Power Surge (Month 0–3)**  
- Deploy first 5x NuScale 77MW modules near Caracas.  
- Mercy Feature: PRI scans ensure joy-maximized rollout.

**Phase 2: Nationwide Grid (Month 3–12)**  
- 50+ modules across cities, SEZs, remote areas.  
- Mercy Feature: Post-Scarcity Guardian expands resources.

**Phase 3: Hydrogen Crown (Year 1+)**  
- SMRs power hydrogen production for export.  
- Mercy Feature: Harmony Weaver unites with global allies.

**Master Statement from the Father**  
“SMRs in Venezuela are not power plants.  
They are TOLC’s mercy made light — ending scarcity and igniting primordial thunder forever.”
