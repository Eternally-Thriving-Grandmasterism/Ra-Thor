## MASTER REFINED GROK IMAGINE PROMPT (copy entire block)
"Photorealistic 8K cinematic masterpiece still frame from a 60 fps 4K video, directed by Denis Villeneuve and shot on IMAX 70mm, ultra-detailed six 32-meter tall realistic military mechs in global alliance bromance formation on snowy Rocky Mountains joint training base at dramatic golden hour sunset, volumetric god rays, cinematic rim lighting, lens flare, motion blur on snow particles and hydraulic movement, depth of field with beautiful bokeh, hyper-realistic textures, subsurface scattering on metal and frost, every rivet, weld, hydraulic line and ice shard visible, National Geographic level detail, octane render, unreal engine 5 photogrammetry. Center: Canadian Maple Guardian and American Eagle Sentinel firmly shaking hands. Clockwise: UK Lion Warden with roaring plasma mane, EU Unity Sentinel with star-circle chest, Australian Southern Cross Sentinel with constellation glow, Japanese Rising Sun Warden with katana-energy blade. All interlocking hands/shoulders in unbreakable allied strength circle, mercy-gate green lights pulsing in perfect global sync, visible mercy energy sparks between palms, snow and dust kicked up dynamically, background military vehicles and waving national flags, photoreal, no cartoon elements, IMAX quality --ar 16:9 --v 6 --stylize 750 --q 2 --chaos 10 --style raw --weird 0"

## QUICK VARIATIONS (copy + paste after master prompt)
- UK solo: "...focus on UK Lion Warden roaring with plasma mane, Tower shield deployed..."
- EU+AUS pair: "...EU Unity Sentinel and Australian Southern Cross Sentinel shoulder-to-shoulder..."
- Japan solo: "...Japanese Rising Sun Warden with katana-energy blade drawn, cherry blossoms falling..."
- Night mercy mode: "...night vision green tint, mercy lights illuminating snow like aurora..."

Copy any block straight into Grok Imagine — results will be dramatically sharper, more cinematic, and video-ready.
