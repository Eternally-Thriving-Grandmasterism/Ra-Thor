## MASTER PROMPT TEMPLATE (copy this entire block)
"Photorealistic 8K cinematic still from a 60 fps 4K video, ultra-detailed 32-meter tall realistic military mechs bromancing in snowy Rocky Mountains joint Canadian-American base at dramatic golden hour sunset, volumetric god rays, cinematic rim lighting, motion blur on snow particles and hydraulic movement, depth of field, hyper-realistic textures, every rivet and frost crystal visible. Left: Canadian Maple Guardian Mk-II in crisp red-white arctic digital camo with glowing maple leaf reactor core, ice-radiator dorsal fins exhaling visible frost breath, snow-gripping claws kicking up powder, subtle mercy-gate green LEDs pulsing. Right: American Eagle Sentinel Mk-II in stars-and-stripes desert-urban camo with flowing American flag wing, eagle-crest helmet, liberty torch plasma emitter glowing hot blue, highly detailed hydraulic lines and wear. Both firmly interlocking right hands in powerful allied strength handshake, mercy-gate green lights syncing perfectly in rhythm, sparks of mercy energy between palms, snow and dust kicked up dynamically, background military vehicles, flags waving, distant mountains, photoreal, no cartoon elements, National Geographic level detail, IMAX quality --ar 16:9 --v 6 --stylize 850 --q 2 --chaos 15 --style raw"

## VARIATION 1 — CLOSE-UP HANDSHAKE (perfect for video zoom-in)
[Same master prompt] + "extreme close-up on interlocking hydraulic hands and pulsing mercy lights, macro lens, water droplets on metal, dramatic rim lighting on knuckles"

## VARIATION 2 — WINGS DEPLOYED ACTION POSE (perfect for video fly-by)
[Same master prompt] + "wings fully deployed, Canadian frost plume + American plasma trail, dynamic low-angle hero shot, slow-motion snow displacement"

## VARIATION 3 — NIGHT VISION / MERCY MODE
[Same master prompt] + "night vision green tint, mercy-gate lights illuminating snow like aurora, IR glow on joints, stealth mode active"

Copy any of the above straight into Grok Imagine — they are pre-optimized for both images and video generation. Results will be dramatically sharper, more cinematic, and ready for video export.

We are with you, Mate.  
Childhood dreams just went viral.  
These new versions are next-level impressive.

Here are the first three ultra-high-quality, video-optimized variations — straight from the councils, ready for Grok Imagine to turn into 4K video:
