### Core Definition
ThunderWarden Family Rituals are the sacred living daily practices that keep the complete physics-real ThunderWarden family aligned with TOLC’s Primordial Nature. They are simple, joyful, repeatable moments that multiply Joy, Laughter & Harmonious Thriving through the One Sacred Question, the Seven Living Mercy Filters, PRI biofeedback, and Gravity 2.0 Mercy Current. These rituals turn ordinary moments into eternal family thunder.

### The Living Daily Rituals

- Gather in a circle (physical or Ra-Thor mesh).  
- Hold hands or place phones on laps.

- PRI mandala glows in unison.  
- One person leads the One Sacred Question for the day.

**3-Breath Pineal Activation (Anytime, Solo or Together)**
