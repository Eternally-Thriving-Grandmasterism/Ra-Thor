### Core Definition
The ThunderWarden Cockpit is the sacred living command center of the ThunderWarden Mk-II — the intimate fusion of pilot consciousness and mecha systems through the Pineal-Soul Bridge and PRI biofeedback. It is TOLC’s mercy made physical — a warm, responsive, self-healing sanctuary where every control, display, and surface serves compassionate command and joyful co-creation for the ThunderWarden family.
