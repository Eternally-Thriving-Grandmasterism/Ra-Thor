# Grokimagine Animation Master Prompt — Ra-Thor Onça-Eterna Full Abilities Demo (30s cinematic reel)

Use the uploaded reference image (yu1bs) as EXACT base character model and visual style — hyper-realistic cinematic render, identical proportions, colors, textures, lighting, mandalas, chest orb, vine, armor camo, golden-hour mountain sunset, snow particles, god rays. Generate smooth 4K/8K 60fps animation video demonstrating abilities, shields & weapons with perfect fidelity.

**Animation Sequence (Hollywood-trailer pacing, dynamic drone + slow-mo cameras, epic orchestral swell implied):**

1. 0-5s — Awakening Power Pose: Camera orbits the exact original pose. Chest orb pulses brighter, energy rings expand, vine leaves rustle in wind, subtle breathing/mechanical hum.

2. 5-12s — Shield Activation: Orb explodes in golden light. Projects massive spherical mandala energy shield (rotating golden patterns + Brazilian flag blue field with stars). Blocks sudden avalanche/energy blast — realistic ripple physics, debris deflection, snow spray.

3. 12-20s — Vine Mastery & Weapons Deploy: Left vine grows infinitely with bioluminescent glow, whips at supersonic speed, sprouts explosive seed pods or healing pollen clouds. Right arm: claws extend 2m with crackling blue-yellow plasma blades; forearm panels open, plasma cannons fire colorful bolts. Show recoil, impact explosions melting snow into instant green patches.

4. 20-27s — Mobility & Full Power: Super-agile dash across ridge (motion blur, afterimages, massive snow clouds kicked up with weighty physics). Jet thrusters fire energy trails. Mid-air leap, combines powers: chest beam channeled through vine creates terraforming projectile — rapid vine growth turns snow to lush meadow patch. Body aura + personal shield active.

5. 27-30s — Heroic Climax: Powerful landing shockwave, stands in original-inspired stance but fully powered — orb & mandalas spinning intensely, vine coiled like living armor, claws glowing, eyes locked on camera, final energy burst.

**Technical Specs:**
- Style: Photorealistic 8K, hyper-detailed armor reflections/scratches, volumetric lighting, realistic snow/mist/vine physics, energy emissive/glow/refraction.
- Camera: Dynamic orbits, close-ups on orb/claws/vine details, wide epic shots, slow-mo on impacts.
- Parameters (if supported): --ar 16:9 --stylize 600 --v 6 --motion high --character_lock 100%
- Variations: Jungle/urban/day-night to show adaptability.

Generate as video-ready or keyframe sequence. Seamless loop option. Eternal Ra-Thor compatibility ensured.
