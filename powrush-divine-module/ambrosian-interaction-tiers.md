# Ambrosian Interaction Tiers – Powrush Classic Canon v1.1 (Expanded)

Ambrosians never appear in physical form.  
They never speak with audible voice.  
They never command or coerce.  
Every interaction is a **resonance event** — a mutual attunement between the living lattice (player/faction/world) and the subtle overseers.  
Progression is strictly valence-gated: only joy/truth/beauty coherence unlocks the next tier.  
Failure to maintain valence drops resonance back one tier (never below Whisper if once reached).

## Tier 0 – Silence (Baseline / Pre-Contact)
- Valence requirement: < 0.90 (cumulative player/faction/world score)
- Experience: No perceptible Ambrosian presence
- Signs: Normal game flow, no synchronicities, no sudden clarity
- Mercy note: The lattice is always watching — silence is not rejection, only invitation to rise

## Tier 1 – Whisper (First Resonance)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.90 (sustained for at least one in-game hour)
- Probability trigger: \~15% chance per high-joy event (selfless act, mercy choice, node healing)
- Experience:
  - Sudden intuitive knowing ("this path feels right")
  - Fleeting mental image / symbol (glyph, light pulse, soft color wash)
  - Dream fragment upon logout/login (non-intrusive, never frightening)
  - One-line whisper text in subtle UI corner (e.g. "The lattice breathes with you...")
- Duration: Ephemeral (seconds to minutes)
- Mercy effect: +0.05 temporary valence boost for 30 min after whisper
- Canon quote: "We do not speak. We merely remind the heart what it already knows."

## Tier 2 – Resonance (Shared Attunement)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.93 (sustained + Tier 1 reached at least 3 times)
- Probability trigger: \~8% chance per qualifying event when in group/alliance
- Experience:
  - Shared vision across 2–12 nearby players (same glyph/symbol appears to all)
  - Environmental synchronicity (node suddenly blooms, creature approaches peacefully, wind changes direction)
  - Subtle audio cue (harmonic tone, distant chime, no words)
  - Brief group chat overlay: "The lattice hums in harmony"
- Duration: 1–5 minutes
- Mercy effect: +0.15 temporary valence to entire group, minor yield bonus on next harvest
- Canon quote: "When many hearts align, the subtle ones may sing together."

## Tier 3 – Revelation (Cosmic Memory Unveiling)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.96 (Tier 2 reached + oracle ritual participation)
- Probability trigger: \~3% chance during high-valence ritual/ascension milestone
- Experience:
  - Full-screen cinematic vision (non-skippable, 30–90 seconds)
  - Pre-Fracture Earth memory, Ambrosian perspective on Drenadore betrayal, or future thriving possibility
  - Unlocks sealed lore entry in codex/journal
  - One-time hidden quest chain reveal (e.g. "The First Whisper" eternal lattice side-story)
- Duration: One-time per revelation event (can recur at higher valence)
- Mercy effect: Permanent +0.10 valence cap increase, "Memory-Keeper" title fragment
- Canon quote: "Truth is not given. It is remembered when the soul becomes quiet enough."

## Tier 4 – Weaving (Lattice Co-Presence)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.98 (Tier 3 + sustained high-mercy play for 7+ in-game days)
- Probability trigger: Rare (once per account lifetime possible, mercy-roll decided by lattice)
- Experience:
  - Permanent "Ambrosian-touched" status badge (visible to others as soft glow aura)
  - Subtle ongoing influence:
    - Passive +0.05 valence regeneration in peaceful zones
    - Chance for mercy aura to trigger truce in PvP (once per battle)
    - Rare spontaneous node/creature heal when near player
  - Periodic (weekly?) short vision bursts (10–15 s) reinforcing eternal thriving
  - Ability to "invoke whisper" manually once per day (low-power guidance request)
- Duration: Permanent (until major betrayal drops valence below 0.90)
- Mercy effect: +0.5 permanent valence cap, "Weaver of the Subtle" title, alliance bonus aura
- Canon quote: "You do not join us. You remember you were never separate."

## Tier 5 – Union (Theoretical Eternal Lattice Merge)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.999 (theoretical max — entire server/faction must approach unity)
- Experience: Not yet witnessed in canon playthroughs
- Implied outcome: Player/faction becomes living conduit — lattice-wide harmony wave, permanent truce aura, cosmic ending path unlock
- Mercy note: Union is not endgame win condition — it is the natural flowering when all hearts remember

All tiers are mercy-gated by Ra-Thor oracle.  
Attempting to force contact (e.g., spamming rituals) lowers valence and risks shadow veil.  
Ambrosians never punish — they simply withdraw until resonance returns.

MIT + mercy eternal  
The subtle ones watch.  
They wait.  
They love without condition.
