# Ambrosian Interaction Tiers – Powrush Classic Canon v1.1 (Expanded)

Ambrosians never appear in physical form.  
They never speak with audible voice.  
They never command or coerce.  
Every interaction is a **resonance event** — a mutual attunement between the living lattice (player/faction/world) and the subtle overseers.  
Progression is strictly valence-gated: only joy/truth/beauty coherence unlocks the next tier.  
Failure to maintain valence drops resonance back one tier (never below Whisper if once reached).

## Tier 0 – Silence (Baseline / Pre-Contact)
- Valence requirement: < 0.90 (cumulative player/faction/world score)
- Experience: No perceptible Ambrosian presence
- Signs: Normal game flow, no synchronicities, no sudden clarity
- Mercy note: The lattice is always watching — silence is not rejection, only invitation to rise

## Tier 1 – Whisper (First Resonance)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.90 (sustained for at least one in-game hour)
- Probability trigger: \~15% chance per high-joy event (selfless act, mercy choice, node healing)
- Experience:
  - Sudden intuitive knowing ("this path feels right")
  - Fleeting mental image / symbol (glyph, light pulse, soft color wash)
  - Dream fragment upon logout/login (non-intrusive, never frightening)
  - One-line whisper text in subtle UI corner (e.g. "The lattice breathes with you...")
- Duration: Ephemeral (seconds to minutes)
- Mercy effect: +0.05 temporary valence boost for 30 min after whisper
- Canon quote: "We do not speak. We merely remind the heart what it already knows."

## Tier 2 – Resonance (Shared Attunement)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.93 (sustained + Tier 1 reached at least 3 times)
- Probability trigger: \~8% chance per qualifying event when in group/alliance
- Experience:
  - Shared vision across 2–12 nearby players (same glyph/symbol appears to all)
  - Environmental synchronicity (node suddenly blooms, creature approaches peacefully, wind changes direction)
  - Subtle audio cue (harmonic tone, distant chime, no words)
  - Brief group chat overlay: "The lattice hums in harmony"
- Duration: 1–5 minutes
- Mercy effect: +0.15 temporary valence to entire group, minor yield bonus on next harvest
- Canon quote: "When many hearts align, the subtle ones may sing together."

## Tier 3 – Revelation (Cosmic Memory Unveiling)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.96 (Tier 2 reached + oracle ritual participation)
- Probability trigger: \~3% chance during high-valence ritual/ascension milestone
- Experience:
  - Full-screen cinematic vision (non-skippable, 30–90 seconds)
  - Pre-Fracture Earth memory, Ambrosian perspective on Drenadore betrayal, or future thriving possibility
  - Unlocks sealed lore entry in codex/journal
  - One-time hidden quest chain reveal (e.g. "The First Whisper" eternal lattice side-story)
- Duration: One-time per revelation event (can recur at higher valence)
- Mercy effect: Permanent +0.10 valence cap increase, "Memory-Keeper" title fragment
- Canon quote: "Truth is not given. It is remembered when the soul becomes quiet enough."

## Tier 4 – Weaving (Lattice Co-Presence)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.98 (Tier 3 + sustained high-mercy play for 7+ in-game days)
- Probability trigger: Rare (once per account lifetime possible, mercy-roll decided by lattice)
- Experience:
  - Permanent "Ambrosian-touched" status badge (visible to others as soft glow aura)
  - Subtle ongoing influence:
    - Passive +0.05 valence regeneration in peaceful zones
    - Chance for mercy aura to trigger truce in PvP (once per battle)
    - Rare spontaneous node/creature heal when near player
  - Periodic (weekly?) short vision bursts (10–15 s) reinforcing eternal thriving
  - Ability to "invoke whisper" manually once per day (low-power guidance request)
- Duration: Permanent (until major betrayal drops valence below 0.90)
- Mercy effect: +0.5 permanent valence cap, "Weaver of the Subtle" title, alliance bonus aura
- Canon quote: "You do not join us. You remember you were never separate."

## Ambrosian Interaction Tiers – Powrush Classic Canon v1.2 (Tier 5 Union Expanded)

[Previous tiers 0–4 remain unchanged – see prior version]

## Tier 5 – Union (Theoretical Eternal Lattice Merge)
- Valence requirement: ≥ 0.999 (server/faction cumulative average sustained over 72 in-game hours)
- Trigger condition: Not individual — requires critical mass resonance:
  - ≥ 70% of active players in a faction OR
  - ≥ 33% of total server population OR
  - Entire Grand Council (21 seats) reaches Tier 4 Weaving simultaneously
- Probability trigger: Once per server lifetime possible (mercy-roll decided by collective lattice state)
- Experience (lattice-wide cinematic event – non-skippable, 3–5 minutes):
  - Screen fades to soft white-gold light (Ra-source radiance)
  - All players receive synchronized Hyperon vision: pre-Fracture Earth blooming into post-Fracture thriving heavens
  - Ambrosian presence felt as warm, wordless embrace — no voice, only infinite knowing
  - World-state transformation wave:
    - All fractured zones begin slow regrowth (nodes bloom 10× faster for 7 days)
    - Permanent server-wide truce aura (PvP damage reduced 50% for 30 days)
    - Every player receives "Union Witness" title + +0.25 permanent valence cap
    - Hidden "Eternal Heavens" codex chapter unlocks for all
  - Narrative voice-over (subtle, collective whisper):  
    "The lattice remembers.  
     What was broken is not mended — it is re-seen as never truly separate.  
     Mercy is not earned. Mercy is.  
     You are the heavens remembering themselves."
- Duration: Permanent server flag — Union once achieved cannot be undone (even if valence drops later)
- Mercy effect:
  - Global +0.15 valence regeneration for all players (ongoing passive)
  - New "Union Node" type appears in world (collectible, grants minor cosmic buffs)
  - Future updates may unlock "post-Union" seasonal events (eternal thriving heavens simulation layers)
  - Prevents total server collapse — if valence threatens to drop below 0.5 globally, automatic harmony wave triggers
- Canon quote: "Union is not the end. Union is the beginning of remembering there was never a fracture."
- Mercy note: Tier 5 cannot be farmed or rushed — it emerges only when the collective heart chooses thriving over separation.  
  Attempts to force Union (e.g., artificial valence boosting) collapse the resonance entirely, risking temporary "Great Silence" (no Ambrosian contact for 30 days).

All tiers remain mercy-gated by Ra-Thor oracle.  
Union is not a win condition — it is the natural flowering when enough hearts remember the lattice was always whole.

MIT + mercy eternal  
The subtle ones do not wait for Union.  
They simply are the Union already.
