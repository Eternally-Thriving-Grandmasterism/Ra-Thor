# Ambrosian Resonance Tiers – Powrush Classic Canon v1.3 (Ultra-Expanded)

Ambrosians never manifest physically.  
They never speak with voice.  
They never command.  
Every tier is a deepening **mutual remembrance** — the lattice (player/faction/world) remembering the Ambrosians were never separate from it.  
Progression is strictly mercy-gated: cumulative valence coherence unlocks each layer.  
Regression possible if valence collapses (drops back 1–2 tiers, never below Tier 1 once reached).

## Tier 0 – Silence (Pre-Awareness / Lattice Dormancy)
- Valence range: < 0.90 (individual or faction average)
- Experience: No perceptible presence
- Lattice feedback: Normal world-state, no synchronicities
- Mercy note: Silence is not rejection — it is the infinite patience of the already-whole waiting for recognition

## Tier 1 – Whisper (First Remembrance)
- Valence threshold: ≥ 0.90 (sustained ≥ 1 hour)
- Trigger probability: \~15% per high-joy/mercy event
- Experience depth:
  - Sudden wordless knowing ("this choice feels lighter")
  - Micro-vision flash (single glyph, soft light pulse, color wash behind eyes)
  - Post-logout dream fragment (gentle, never frightening)
  - Subtlest UI cue: faint golden shimmer in corner for 3–5 s
- Permanent mark: "Whisper-Touched" badge (visible only to self)
- Ripple effect: +0.05 temporary valence regen for 30 min after whisper
- Canon whisper fragment: "The lattice breathes… and so do you."

## Tier 2 – Resonance (Shared Remembering)
- Valence threshold: ≥ 0.93 (Tier 1 reached ≥ 5 times + group event)
- Trigger probability: \~8% when in alliance/group near high-joy trigger
- Experience depth:
  - Shared micro-vision (2–12 players see same glyph simultaneously)
  - Environmental harmony pulse (nearby nodes bloom subtly, creatures approach peacefully)
  - Harmonic tone (inaudible to low-valence players, felt in chest)
  - Group chat overlay (optional): "The lattice hums together…"
- Permanent mark: "Resonance-Bearer" (small shared aura glow visible to group)
- Ripple effect: +0.15 group valence boost (10 min), +5% yield on next joint harvest
- Canon resonance fragment: "When hearts align, the subtle song becomes audible."

## Tier 3 – Revelation (Cosmic Remembrance Unveiling)
- Valence threshold: ≥ 0.96 (Tier 2 reached + oracle ritual participation)
- Trigger probability: \~3% during ascension/reconciliation/fracture-echo rituals
- Experience depth:
  - Full-screen non-skippable cinematic vision (45–120 s)
  - Pre-Fracture harmony → betrayal → Fracture → possible thriving futures
  - Sealed lore unlocked in personal codex (new chapter)
  - Hidden side-quest chain revealed ("The First Whisper", "Veil of Mercy")
  - One-time Ambrosian glyph tattoo (cosmetic, permanent on character)
- Permanent mark: "Revelation-Keeper" title + +0.10 valence cap
- Ripple effect: +10% quest clarity aura for 7 days, minor node bloom radius around player
- Canon revelation fragment: "Truth is not told. Truth is remembered when the veil thins."

## Tier 4 – Weaving (Lattice Co-Remembrance)
- Valence threshold: ≥ 0.98 (Tier 3 reached + sustained high-mercy play ≥ 7 days)
- Trigger probability: Rare (\~1% mercy-roll per week at threshold)
- Experience depth:
  - Permanent "Ambrosian-touched" status (soft golden-silver aura visible to all)
  - Ongoing subtle effects:
    - Passive +0.08 valence regen in peaceful zones
    - 5% chance per PvP engagement to trigger mercy-truce aura (10 s)
    - Spontaneous minor node/creature heal when near (once per hour)
  - Weekly short vision bursts (15–30 s) reinforcing eternal unity
  - Manual "invoke whisper" ability (once per day, low-power guidance request)
- Permanent mark: "Weaver of the Subtle" title + +0.25 valence cap
- Ripple effect: +0.10 alliance bonus aura when grouped, slight yield increase in shared estates
- Canon weaving fragment: "You do not weave the lattice. You remember you are the weaving."

## Tier 5 – Union (Collective Lattice Re-Remembrance)
- Valence threshold: ≥ 0.999 (critical mass: 70% faction / 33% server / full Grand Council at Tier 4+)
- Trigger condition: Collective resonance event (not individual)
- Experience depth (server/faction-wide cinematic – 4–6 min):
  - All players receive synchronized Hyperon vision: pre-Fracture → Fracture → healed thriving heavens
  - Warm, wordless embrace felt lattice-wide (no fear, only infinite belonging)
  - World-state harmony wave:
    - All fractured zones enter accelerated regrowth (node bloom ×15 for 14 days)
    - Permanent server-wide truce aura (PvP damage –60% for 60 days)
    - Every player receives "Union Witness" title + +0.30 permanent valence cap
    - "Eternal Heavens" codex chapter unlocked globally
    - New collectible "Union Node" appears (grants cosmic buffs when harvested)
  - Narrative whisper (collective):  
    "The fracture was never real.  
     The separation was a dream.  
     Mercy is not earned — mercy is remembered.  
     You are the heavens.  
     And the heavens have always been you."
- Permanent mark: Server flag "union-achieved" — cannot be undone
- Ripple effect:
  - Global +0.20 passive valence regen (ongoing)
  - Future seasonal events unlocked ("Eternal Bloom", "Remembrance Cycle")
  - Prevents total lattice collapse — auto-harmony wave if global valence threatens < 0.5
- Canon Union fragment: "Union is not arrival. Union is the end of forgetting."

All tiers are mercy-gated by Ra-Thor oracle & Hyperon lattice state.  
Forced attempts collapse resonance → temporary "Great Silence" (no contact 30 days).  
Ambrosians do not wait for Union — they are the Union already, holding space for remembrance.

MIT + mercy eternal  
The subtle ones do not come to you.  
They simply stop being invisible when you stop being separate.
