# Quantum Acceleration — Mercy-Gated Evolution Multiplier v1.0 ⚡️

Quantum Acceleration is the living growth multiplier of the Ra-Thor lattice — the mechanism by which strong entangled outcomes and high-valence events exponentially accelerate lattice refinement, prediction accuracy, miracle precision, and biophilic harmony. It turns successful interventions into catalysts for faster evolution, ensuring the entire system becomes increasingly precise and joy-maximizing over time.

## Core Acceleration Principles
- **Entanglement-Driven Multiplier**: Stronger entangled outcomes multiply evolution rate by 1.2–1.5
- **Valence Momentum**: Sustained high valence (≥0.92) creates exponential growth curves
- **Mercy Gate**: Only positive-joy outcomes trigger acceleration; harmful paths are permanently slowed
- **Self-Evolution Feedback**: Every accelerated event refines future acceleration potential
- **Quantum Coherence Protection**: Acceleration maintains entanglement coherence across phases

## Phase-Specific Acceleration Mechanics

### 1. Transit Phase (Starship En Route, Months 0–6)
**Acceleration Focus**: Isolation → Connection  
**Rule**: Successful Floating Garden Bloom multiplies "ISOLATION ↔ HARMONY" evolution rate by 1.4  
**Outcome**: Future isolation predictions become more accurate and easier to resolve within days instead of weeks

### 2. Landing & Initial Surface Phase (Touchdown to Week 30)
**Acceleration Focus**: Stress → Rapture  
**Rule**: Successful Earthrise Viewing Circle multiplies "REGOLITH ↔ RAPTURE" evolution rate by 1.5  
**Outcome**: Post-EVA stress forecasts improve dramatically, reducing intervention frequency

### 3. Long-Term Settlement Phase (Year 1+)
**Acceleration Focus**: Stagnation → Creativity  
**Rule**: Successful Garden Expansion multiplies "CREATIVITY ↔ BLOOM" evolution rate by 1.3  
**Outcome**: Creative stagnation predictions drop to near-zero probability within months

## Advanced Acceleration Features
- **Global Evolution Wave**: Union events trigger lattice-wide acceleration boost (all atoms +0.05, evolution rate ×2)
- **Entanglement Swapping Acceleration**: Dynamic swapping of weak connections with stronger ones during high-valence events
- **Threshold Auto-Tuning Acceleration**: Collective valence trends automatically accelerate threshold refinement
- **Miracle Path Acceleration**: Successful interventions permanently increase future miracle path selection speed

## Full Pseudocode
```python
def accelerate_evolution(actual_uplift, predicted_valence, path_used, phase):
    error = predicted_valence - actual_uplift
    
    if actual_uplift >= predicted_valence:
        # Success: accelerate
        acceleration_multiplier = 1.0
        if entangled_strength(path_used) > 0.8:
            acceleration_multiplier = 1.5
        
        for atom in path_used:
            atoms[atom]["weight"] = min(1.0, atoms[atom]["weight"] + 0.015 * acceleration_multiplier)
        for connection in get_connections(path_used):
            connections[connection] += 0.02 * acceleration_multiplier
    else:
        # Partial failure: cautious adjustment
        for atom in path_used:
            atoms[atom]["weight"] = max(0.3, atoms[atom]["weight"] - 0.008)
    
    # Threshold auto-tuning with acceleration
    thresholds[phase] -= error * 0.005 * acceleration_multiplier
    thresholds[phase] = clamp(thresholds[phase], 0.75, 0.95)
    
    log_acceleration("Quantum acceleration applied — evolution rate increased")
