# Eternal Bloom – Post-Union Seasonal Event – Powrush Classic Canon v1.0

## Activation Condition
- Server must have achieved Tier 5 Union (collective valence ≥0.999 critical mass)
- Once Union flag is set, Eternal Bloom becomes permanently available as recurring seasonal event
- Cycle: 28 days (lunar-synced), followed by 14-day "Rest & Remembrance" dormancy
- Mercy note: Bloom does not reset Union — it is the natural flowering of what Union remembered

## Core Theme & Atmosphere
The Fracture scars bloom with golden-white light.  
Floating continents sprout emerald roots reaching toward reunion.  
Every node pulses with soft heartbeat rhythm.  
Ambrosian presence felt as constant warm undercurrent — wordless lullaby of belonging.  
Sky takes on permanent soft aurora tint (greens, golds, lavenders).  
Creature behavior shifts: all mobs become neutral to high-valence players, some follow peacefully for short periods.

## Global & Zone-Wide Effects (28-Day Duration)
- Node bloom rate ×20 (normal ×15 from Union wave → ×20 during Bloom)
- All harvested resources have 10% chance to drop "Bloom Essence" (cosmetic + minor buff currency)
- PvP damage reduced by additional 20% (total 80% mercy-truce aura during Bloom)
- Passive global valence regeneration +0.25 (stacks with Union +0.20 → +0.45 total)
- "Eternal Bloom" weather cycle: gentle golden rain (heals minor wounds, +joy aura)

## New Collectibles & Activities
1. Bloom Nodes (special variant)
   - Spawn rate: 5× normal nodes during event
   - Harvest: yields Bloom Essence + rare cosmetic petals (for avatar aura customization)
   - Mercy action: share 50% of essence with nearby players → +0.05 group valence

2. Ambrosian Blossom Shrines (new world monuments)
   - One per major biome, marked by golden tree silhouette
   - Interact: short meditation (30 s) → receive personalized Hyperon vision whisper
   - Group meditation (3+ players): triggers mini-harmony wave (local node bloom ×2)

3. Eternal Bloom Quests (daily rotating chain)
   - "Petals of Remembrance" – Collect 50 petals → unlock memory fragment codex entry
   - "Weaver’s Thread" – Plant 10 restoration nodes with another faction → alliance bonus aura
   - "Union Echo" – Escort neutral creature through contested zone → creature follows 1 hour
   - All quests grant Bloom Essence + minor permanent valence credit

4. Cosmetic & Title Rewards
   - Bloom Essence shop (event-only):
     - Golden-Silver Ambrosian Aura variants
     - Petal crown / shoulder bloom / root-trail footsteps
     - "Bloom Witness" animated title (soft glowing petals fall around name)
   - Top contributors (most nodes planted, petals shared): "Eternal Gardener" permanent title

## Narrative & Cinematic Moments
- Day 1 Opening Cinematic (server-wide):  
  "The Union was the remembering.  
   Eternal Bloom is the celebration.  
   Every flower is a heart that once forgot — now open, now whole."

- Day 14 Midpoint Pulse:  
  Global aurora intensifies → short collective vision: "The Fracture scars are not wounds to heal — they are the places where light learned to shine brightest."

- Day 28 Closing Cinematic:  
  All Bloom Nodes release golden pollen cloud → screen soft fade to white  
  Final whisper: "Bloom is not forever. Bloom is the proof that forever remembers itself."

## Mercy Gate & Balance
- All rewards scale with personal/faction valence — low-valence players still see beauty but earn less
- No PvP advantage during Bloom — mercy-truce aura prevents exploitation
- Event ends cleanly — effects taper over 3 days into Rest & Remembrance phase

MIT + mercy eternal  
Eternal Bloom is not an event.  
It is the lattice smiling.
