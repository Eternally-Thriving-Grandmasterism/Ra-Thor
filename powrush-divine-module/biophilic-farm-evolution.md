# Biophilic Farm Evolution — Living Self-Evolving Paradise System v1.0 ⚡️

Biophilic Farm Evolution is the living growth engine of MercyStarship habitats — farms that self-evolve through Hyperon NEAT mechanics, valence feedback, and quantum entanglement. Every plant, every harvest, every bloom resonates with the lattice, adapting in real-time to crew needs and mission phases for infinite joy/truth/beauty nourishment.

## Core Evolution Principles
- **Valence-Driven Growth**: Higher crew joy accelerates farm complexity and yield
- **NEAT Self-Evolution**: Topologies of farm layouts evolve through mutation, crossover, and speciation
- **Quantum Entanglement**: Farms on different habitats influence each other instantly
- **Mercy Gate**: Only positive-joy growth patterns are manifested; harmful mutations collapse to zero
- **Cradle-to-Cradle**: Zero-waste, regenerative cycles with MercyGel symbiosis

## Phase-Specific Farm Evolution

### 1. Transit Phase (Starship En Route, Months 0–6)
**Evolution Focus**: Microgravity adaptation  
**Key Mechanisms**:
- Aeroponic towers evolve capillary action topologies based on fluid shift data
- Valence feedback from crew joy strengthens herb yield and flavor intensity
- NEAT mutation: New zero-G herb configurations emerge from successful harvests

**Outcome**: Farms evolve from basic microgreens to full flavor rotation systems within weeks

### 2. Landing & Initial Surface Phase (Touchdown to Week 30)
**Evolution Focus**: Regolith integration  
**Key Mechanisms**:
- Soil analog topologies evolve through regolith amendment feedback
- Quantum entanglement links transit farms to surface domes — successful transit harvests instantly boost surface bloom
- Miracle Intervention: Sudden berry patch expansion when post-EVA stress is forecasted

**Outcome**: Farms evolve from regolith survival to abundant first harvests within days

### 3. Long-Term Settlement Phase (Year 1+)
**Evolution Focus**: Generational thriving  
**Key Mechanisms**:
- Vertical farm topologies evolve for multi-generational optimization (child-friendly layouts)
- Global evolution wave during Union events triggers lattice-wide farm expansion
- NEAT speciation creates specialized sub-farms (medicinal, celebratory, child-rearing)

**Outcome**: Farms evolve into self-sustaining arcology ecosystems supporting thousands

## Hyperon NEAT Evolution Pseudocode
```python
def evolve_farm_layout(current_layout, valence_feedback, phase):
    # Evaluate fitness based on valence uplift
    fitness = calculate_farm_valence_uplift(current_layout, valence_feedback)
    
    # Speciate and select elites
    species = speciate_farm_layouts(population)
    elites = select_elites(species)
    
    # Crossover and mutate
    new_layout = crossover(elites[0], elites[1])
    if random.random() < 0.05:
        new_layout = mutate_farm_layout(new_layout)  # add new crop layers, adjust lighting
    
    # Mercy gate
    if validate_mercy_gate(new_layout):
        return new_layout
    return current_layout  # reject harmful mutations
