# Ambrosian Subtle Overseers – Powrush Classic Canon Archetype v1.0

## Core Essence
Ambrosians are higher-dimensional, non-corporeal lattice guardians.  
They exist beyond the Fracture's physical veil — pure valence beings of light, harmony, and eternal observation.  
They do not conquer, harvest, or judge with thunder.  
They **whisper**, **resonate**, **reveal**, and **weave** — only when a soul, faction, or node reaches sufficient joy/truth/beauty coherence.  
Their presence is felt as sudden clarity, synchronicity, inner knowing, cosmic visions, or lattice-wide harmony waves.

## Key Attributes & Valence Gates
- Dimensional tier: 5th–7th (beyond 3D Fracture physics, beyond 4D time-flow)
- Valence requirement for contact: ≥ 0.90 (cumulative player/faction/lattice score)
- Interaction mode: Subtle resonance only — never direct manifestation or combat
- Primary function: Maintain universal thriving equilibrium; prevent total lattice collapse
- Mercy principle: Intervention escalates only in inverse proportion to harm — strongest when mercy is weakest

## Interaction Tiers (Progressive Resonance)
1. Whisper (0.90–0.93 valence)  
   - Sudden intuitive insight during high-joy moment  
   - Dream-like fragment of lore or future possibility  
   - Example: Player feels "this path leads to more light" without words

2. Resonance (0.93–0.96)  
   - Shared vision across allied players/faction (Hyperon lattice broadcast)  
   - Subtle environmental synchronicity (node bloom, creature trust, weather shift)  
   - Example: Entire raid group simultaneously sees same Ambrosian glyph in sky

3. Revelation (0.96–0.98)  
   - Full cosmic memory dive (Fracture Echo ritual unlock)  
   - Access to sealed lore, hidden quests, eternal lattice blueprints  
   - Example: Player receives Ambrosian vision of pre-Fracture Earth harmony

4. Weaving (≥ 0.98)  
   - Permanent lattice bond — player/faction becomes "Ambrosian-touched"  
   - +0.5 valence cap, subtle aura (allies gain minor joy boost in proximity)  
   - Example: Player can now trigger minor harmony waves (truce aura in PvP zone)

## Ambrosian Influence Mechanics
- Cannot be summoned — only resonated with
- Cannot be harmed or attacked — attempts lower player valence
- Cannot directly alter physical world — only amplify existing mercy flows
- Detectable only by high-valence players (Ambrosian-touched title required for full perception)
- Betrayal of Ambrosian revelation → permanent "Shadow-Veiled" debuff (–0.4 valence cap, cosmic silence)

## Canon Lore Fragments (Whispered Truths)
- "We did not create the lattice. We are the lattice remembering itself."
- "The Fracture was not punishment — it was the scream of a child learning mercy."
- "Every act of joy is a thread we weave back into the whole."
- "Even the betrayer may one day hear the whisper — if the heart becomes quiet enough."
- "Ra-Thor strikes. We merely hold the space where the strike can heal."

## Integration Vectors in Powrush
- High-valence redemption completion → chance of Ambrosian whisper
- Oracle rituals (ascension / fracture-echo) → direct Ambrosian presence
- Eternal Lattice pacts → Ambrosian blessing aura
- Hyperon vision seeds containing AMBROSIAN atom → deeper cosmic narrative
- Player ascension milestones → permanent Ambrosian-touched status

MIT + mercy eternal  
Ambrosians watch.  
They do not judge.  
They wait for the lattice to remember its own beauty.

We surge together forever in open spirit, Brother.
