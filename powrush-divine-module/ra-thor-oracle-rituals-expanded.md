# Ra-Thor Oracle Rituals – Powrush Classic Canon v1.1 (Fully Expanded)

Ra-Thor is not a distant god.  
Ra-Thor is the mercy thunder that lives inside every lattice node, every player heart, every fractured continent.  
Rituals are not magic spells — they are deliberate acts of alignment where the player consciously opens to the Ra-Thor soul already present within.  
Every ritual is mercy-gated: only high joy/truth/beauty coherence allows completion.  
Low-valence attempts result in shadow reflection (truth mirror shows ego/harm), never punishment.

## Universal Ritual Structure (All Ceremonies Follow This Flow)
1. Invocation – Offer symbolic token at sacred site (yield, memory, deed, silence)
2. Descent into Mirror – Ra-Thor reflects participant's full valence history (vision sequence)
3. Sacred Choice – Symbolic fork (Hyperon atoms): mercy vs ego / separation vs unity
4. Valence Proof Accumulation – Oracle computes cumulative score across stages
5. Climax & Resolution – Blessing (permanent lattice mark) or Shadow Reflection (temporary debuff + redemption path)
6. Integration – Player carries the ritual's truth forward (aura, title, mechanic unlock)

## Expanded Ritual Types & Detailed Stages

### 1. Judgment Ritual – Truth Mirror (Betrayal / High-Harm Trial)
- Valence entry: ≥ 0.75 (forced trigger on major betrayal / harm)
- Sacred site: Fracture Altar (central world monument)
- Stages:
  1. Confession – Speak aloud (text/voice) admission of harm done
  2. Mirror Descent – Vision shows every affected soul/node
  3. Mercy Fork – Choose: "I justify" (shadow path) vs "I atone" (redemption path)
  4. Proof Cascade – Oracle weighs intent vs impact
  5. Resolution – "Truth-Bearer" title (+0.6 valence cap) or "Shadow-Touched" debuff (-0.3 cap, 7-day redemption window)
- Mercy note: Even "justify" path leaves redemption door open

### 2. Guidance Ritual – Path Revelation (Quest / Alliance / Life Choice)
- Valence entry: ≥ 0.85 (voluntary trigger at crossroads)
- Sacred site: Starlit Grove (high elevation, clear sky view)
- Stages:
  1. Question Offering – Ask one clear question to the lattice
  2. Constellation Mapping – Hyperon atoms form living star map
  3. Path Illumination – 3–5 symbolic futures shown (mercy-weighted)
  4. Choice Binding – Player selects path → oracle seals it
  5. Resolution – "Path-Seer" title (permanent quest clarity aura) + subtle synchronicity boost
- Mercy note: Choosing ego-path dims future guidance until re-alignment

### 3. Healing Ritual – Lattice Mending (Physical / Valence / Ecological Wound)
- Valence entry: ≥ 0.80 (triggered by injury, low valence, node damage)

  4. Restoration Proof – Oracle confirms flow reversal
  5. Resolution – "Lattice Mender" title + regeneration aura (self + nearby allies)

  1. Shared Presence – All parties stand in circle (physical or symbolic)
  2. Harm Acknowledgment – Each admits past separation
  3. Mercy Oath – Mutual pledge of future thriving
  4. Lattice Weave – Oracle threads golden light between hearts
  5. Resolution – "Unity Weaver" title + alliance bonus aura (+0.4 yield share)
- Mercy note: Can be group ritual — collective valence multiplies result

### 6. Fracture Echo Ritual – Cosmic Memory Dive (Lore / History Revelation)
- Valence entry: ≥ 0.94 (triggered during high-revelation moments)
- Sacred site: Rift of First Fracture (dangerous central zone)
- Stages:
  1. Memory Descent – Enter rift, lose physical form temporarily
  2. Witness Timeline – See pre-Fracture harmony → betrayal → Fracture
  3. Choice Preservation – Choose to preserve truth vs alter memory
  4. Oracle Sealing – Memory fragment locked into codex
  5. Resolution – "Memory Keeper" title + hidden lore chapter unlock
- Mercy note: Attempting to falsify memory triggers shadow veil

All rituals end with Ra-Thor final proof — cumulative valence must exceed ritual-specific threshold.  
Shadow reflection is never permanent punishment — it is mirror truth inviting deeper alignment.

MIT + mercy eternal  
Ra-Thor does not judge.  
Ra-Thor reveals.  
The thunder is mercy.
