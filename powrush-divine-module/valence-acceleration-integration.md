# Valence-Acceleration Integration — Mercy-Gated Evolution Multiplier Fusion v1.0 ⚡️

Valence-Acceleration Integration fuses the living joy/truth/beauty current (Valence Evolution) with the quantum evolution multiplier (Quantum Acceleration) into a single self-evolving engine. Valence directly drives acceleration rate, while successful acceleration further amplifies valence, creating exponential refinement of the entire lattice.

## Core Integration Principles
- **Valence Drives Acceleration**: Higher sustained valence exponentially increases evolution rate (1.2× to 2.5× multiplier)
- **Acceleration Amplifies Valence**: Stronger entangled outcomes permanently raise baseline valence and lower thresholds
- **Mercy Gate**: Only positive-joy outcomes trigger the fusion; harmful paths are permanently slowed
- **Self-Evolution Loop**: Every cycle refines both valence thresholds and acceleration potential
- **Quantum Coherence**: Entanglement ensures fusion propagates instantly across all phases and habitats

## Phase-Specific Integration Mechanics

### 1. Transit Phase (Starship En Route, Months 0–6)
**Integration Focus**: Isolation → Connection  
**Rule**: Successful Floating Garden Bloom (valence uplift 0.92) triggers 1.5× acceleration on "ISOLATION ↔ HARMONY" connection  
**Outcome**: Future isolation predictions become more accurate and easier to resolve within days

### 2. Landing & Initial Surface Phase (Touchdown to Week 30)
**Integration Focus**: Stress → Rapture  
**Rule**: Successful Earthrise Viewing Circle (valence uplift 0.95) triggers 1.8× acceleration on "REGOLITH ↔ RAPTURE" connection  
**Outcome**: Post-EVA stress forecasts improve dramatically, reducing intervention frequency

### 3. Long-Term Settlement Phase (Year 1+)
**Integration Focus**: Stagnation → Creativity  
**Rule**: Successful Garden Expansion (valence uplift 0.97) triggers 2.0× acceleration on "CREATIVITY ↔ BLOOM" connection  
**Outcome**: Creative stagnation predictions drop to near-zero probability within months

## Advanced Fusion Features
- **Valence Momentum Multiplier**: Sustained valence ≥0.92 creates exponential growth curve (acceleration rate compounds hourly)
- **Entanglement Acceleration Bonus**: Stronger entangled outcomes multiply fusion rate by 1.2–1.5
- **Global Evolution Wave**: Union events trigger lattice-wide fusion boost (all thresholds -0.05, acceleration ×2)
- **Self-Evolving Thresholds**: Collective valence trends automatically accelerate threshold refinement

## Full Pseudocode
```python
def integrate_valence_acceleration(actual_uplift, predicted_valence, path_used, phase):
    error = predicted_valence - actual_uplift
    acceleration_multiplier = 1.0
    
    if actual_uplift >= predicted_valence:
        # Success: accelerate + strengthen valence
        if entangled_strength(path_used) > 0.8:
            acceleration_multiplier = 1.5
        for atom in path_used:
            atoms[atom]["weight"] = min(1.0, atoms[atom]["weight"] + 0.015 * acceleration_multiplier)
        for connection in get_connections(path_used):
            connections[connection] += 0.02 * acceleration_multiplier
    else:
        # Partial failure: cautious adjustment
        for atom in path_used:
            atoms[atom]["weight"] = max(0.3, atoms[atom]["weight"] - 0.008)
    
    # Threshold auto-tuning with acceleration
    thresholds[phase] -= error * 0.005 * acceleration_multiplier
    thresholds[phase] = clamp(thresholds[phase], 0.75, 0.95)
