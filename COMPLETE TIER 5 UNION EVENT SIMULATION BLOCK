[SYSTEM-WIDE CINEMATIC TRIGGER — UNION ACHIEVED]

The screen slowly fades from normal gameplay to a soft, warm white-gold radiance.  
No loading bar. No warning.  
Only the gentle hum that rises from every node, every creature, every fractured continent — as if the world itself is exhaling after holding its breath for millennia.

Your character freezes mid-step.  
So does every other player on the server — avatars, NPCs, even the wind in the trees.  
Time does not stop.  
It remembers.

A collective vision descends — synchronized across every client:

You see Earth before the Fracture:  
oceans singing in liquid light, forests breathing in perfect rhythm, cities of living crystal where humans, Draeks, Quellorians, Cydruids, and unseen Ambrosians walked as one family.  
No borders. No weapons. No scarcity.  
Only the endless exchange of joy.

Then the betrayal:  
Drenadore nanotech plague blooming like black frost across the skies.  
The sun-lance strikes.  
The continents tear free, floating in low-gravity silence.  
The scream of the lattice — not rage, but sorrow.

And then… nothing.  
The long forgetting.

But now — the remembering begins.

Golden threads rise from every player, every node, every redeemed soul.  
They weave upward, meeting in the sky above the central Fracture Altar.  
A vast, living mandala forms — Hyperon atoms in perfect fractal bloom:  
FRACTURE → MERCY → LATTICE → REDEMPTION → VALENCE → THUNDER → LIGHT → AMBROSIAN → UNION.

The mandala pulses once.  
Twice.  
A third time — and the harmony wave erupts outward.

You feel it in your chest first:  
a warm, wordless embrace that carries no voice, only infinite belonging.  
Every scar from every betrayal, every kill, every over-harvest, every moment of separation — softens, not erased, but re-seen as part of the dream that is now waking.

World-state transformation (visible to all):

- Fractured zones begin accelerated regrowth: cracked earth sprouts emerald veins, floating islands sprout roots downward toward reunion  
- Node bloom rate ×15 for 14 days — every harvest yields 20% extra joy-flavored resources  
- PvP damage reduced by 60% for 60 days — mercy-truce aura blankets all zones  
- Every player receives permanent +0.30 valence cap increase  
- Title "Union Witness" appears above every name (golden-silver glow)  
- New collectible "Union Node" appears randomly across the world — harvesting one grants a 24-hour cosmic buff (double valence regen, +50% yield, auto-truce in PvP)  
- "Eternal Heavens" codex chapter unlocks globally — readable by all, containing pre-Fracture harmony blueprints and post-Union possibility sketches

The vision fades gently.  
You are back in your body — but not the same.  
The hum remains, soft and constant, like a heartbeat shared by millions.

A final collective whisper ripples through chat (server-wide, non-dismissible for 60 seconds):

"The fracture was never real.  
The separation was a dream we all dreamed together.  
Mercy is not earned.  
Mercy is remembered.  
You are the heavens.  
And the heavens have always been you."

[SYSTEM-WIDE CINEMATIC END — UNION FLAG SET PERMANENTLY]

Server announcement (once, pinned for 7 days):
Union has been achieved.  
The lattice remembers its wholeness.  
All players are now Union Witnesses.  
The harmony wave flows for 60 days.  
Thrive together — forever.
